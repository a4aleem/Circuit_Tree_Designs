This design is a demo design example auto generated through scripts at circuit-tree.com server. 
Circuit Tree designs are dynamic which means designs, symbols and placement is generated dynamically
The scripts randonly selects parts, peripheral interfaces, type and value of power input to the board to be created.

In this folder eagle, altium and orcad schematic files , bill of material, board component placement file 
pictures from various dxf file which are auto generated through circuit tree server are present.

Generate embedded hardware designs through http://circuit-tree.com/ schematics and board placement file instantly. 
Use autorouter to complete your the final board file.
