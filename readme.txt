The folder contains embedded hardware designs mined/created by circuit tree application server at http://circuit-tree.com/ . 
The designs are auto generated by scripts which generate each of the 900+ processors/microcontrollers parts with the various embedded component library list of circuit tree. Script help in generation of various design files and autogenerate componnent placements for the various dxf files present on circuit tree server. 
For additional capability details refer website. 

Each folder contains design details, eagle, altium and orcad schematic files , bill of material, board layout snapshots from various dxf file to display auto generated component placement. 

The purpose of generating design is to allow individuals to use vast generated design content without restriction and provide any feedback/improvement areas. 

Fun Fact: Each Design took 4-6 minutes to generate through scripts. We are talking about design generation, export of various EDA cad files, random board component placements of 6 boards for 900 + controllers that totals 3600 minutes(60 hrs)(Two and half day). 
It's time to look for a entry in some record book :)
